# QR-Code-Tabling-System
This project is a web-based QR code tabling system developed for Restaurants, designed to enhance the dining experience by allowing customers to easily browse the menu, place orders directly from their smartphones.

# Features
**Dynamic Menu Interface:** Customers can scan a QR code at their table to access a digital menu. The menu is divided into sections: Desserts, Main Course, Starters, Biryanis, and Beverages, each with a visually distinct design featuring curved borders and a red gradient.

**Intuitive Ordering**: Users can add items to their cart and adjust quantities using the '+' and '-' buttons. The cart page displays the selected items and the total amount in Indian rupees. If no items are selected, the user is prompted to choose items before placing an order.

**Responsive Design:** The system is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms.

**Order Confirmation:** After placing an order, a confirmation popup appears, notifying the customer that their order will be delivered soon. The order details are then sent directly to the kitchen operator's interface.
